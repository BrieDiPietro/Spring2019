**Review of Last Class**

**Late Second Temple Period**
    *Maccabee/Hasmonean Family
    *Herodian Family
Alexander dies: Seleucids(not hands off at all), Ptolemies (super hands off)
198 BCE: Seleucids take Egypt (Judea)

- 200 - 170: Sel. remain mostly hands off; Jews practice however they want to
- Antiochus IV (Antiochus Epiphanes)ambitious, wanted to fully take Egypt
- Rome says that Antiochus IV needs to stop in Egypt
- He removes from Egypt and is pissed, takes anger out in Judea
- Hellenism is in full swing: creates an issue for the traditional and the hellenized

Antiochus then decides that Greek is the stuff; everyone in the kingdom should be Greek
- outlaw stuff to make folks more Greek
    - no more Sabbath observance
    - demands sacrifice to him/Greek deities
    - makes the Temple unfit for Jewish worship
    - no more circumcision
- Jewish high priest (used to be the most important position)
    - people start bribing Antiochus to be the high priest
    - Jason and Menalaus
    - both completely on board with Hellenizing Judaism

***167 - 164 BCE: Maccabeen Family***
- spark revolt against the Hellenizers (Maccabeen/Hasmonean Revolt)
- tipping point: making everyone worship another god; slaughter a man as he's about to give sacrifice
- 164: took the Temple back from the Seleucids
- this is when Hanukkah is celebrated for
- not only is the Temple restored, but it is the underdog that wins
- 142: the Macabbees are officialy recognized as independent from Seleucids

***142 - 63 BCE: Hasmonean Period***
- Simon is the High Priest, recognized by Seleucids
- son John Hyrcanus rules much longer
- son, less important, Aristobulus rules
- son Alexander Jannaeus rules way longer; other groups become more prevalent (Pharisees, Saducees)
- wife Alexandra rules for a hot minute
- both sons are around for a while (Hyrcanus II is army and Aristobulus II High Priest)
- expand territorial reach: lots of folks but the important ones
  - Hyrcanius took Samaria (took Samarian temple): destory temple
  - Samaria vs Judea tension is increasing
  - Hasmoneans are priestly family, but not High Priests: their claim to High Priest is shaky, Samarian High Priest was older and more legitimate (no one could have a decent claim to his rule)
  - Samarian Pentetuach also creates some issues
  - Hyrcanius takes Idumaea (non Jews): Convert or leave; forced circumcision; where the Herod family comes from (not really a part of the Jews)
  - Hyrcanius takes Galilee (non Jews): Convert or leave; forced circumcision
- prosperity for many: control trade routes (get rich)
- major highway running from Damascus/Babylon to Egypt, has to go through Hasmonean territory
- many felt Hasmoneans were not legitimate rulers -> freedom with discomfort

***62 - 6 BCE: Herodian Period***
- senatorial provinces
- imperial provinces (not Herod- ruled directly)
- client state (when Herod is around)
King Herod comes to power
- he's an ambitious man...
- at age 40 he's in Rome fleeing for his life
- Romans are friends with Herod's father
- Romans are friends with Herod
- Romans declare him king, then he goes back to win rule
  - kills lots of competitors (drowns Aristobulus)
  - really large territory
  - rules: 37 - 4 BCE
  - he's a builder: lots of it still standing
      - Cesarea: harbor- control trade, theater, named for Caesar
      - Herodium: fortress (essentially a pyramid, see it from Jerusalem), his tomb
      - Masada: Romans would eventually make a siege ramp and took down the fortress (took a couple years)
      - Herod's Temple: Second Temple: leveled and redid the Temple with platform and beauty
  - he's very cruel
      - puts to death one of his wife and 2 sons
      - got rid of all of the capable heirs
      - the people who took over were very mediocre (wife number 4, 5 and Philip)
      - all of the Herod's discussed in the NT; not usually distinguished
- a bunch of people go to Rome asking for not a Herodian ruler
- Romans honor Herod's will; split area into 3
    - Archelaus
    - Herod Philip
    - Herod Antipas
    - Decapolis: they don't want anyting to do with Jewish stuff, Rome agrees and makes them free
- Herod Archelaus is removed by the Romans
- John the Baptist is beheaded by Herod Antipas in Perea
- Jesus is pretty much always in the territory of Herod Antipas; a touch of Philip, and then dies in Jerusalem
- Pilate doesn't really see much wrong with Jesus, but Herod Antipas was in Jerusalem and says get rid of this guy
- Herod Agrippa: rules for 3 years and is killed (book of Acts)
*The Herodian Line is pretty much just around all the time*

***6 BCE - 41 CE: Direct Roman Rule***
- Pilate: known for being really mean; did things to provoke Jews and then kill them
- Judea is not a happy place for being a ruler; it's not important


66 - 70 CE: revolt against the Romans
Titus/Vespasian destroys in the year 70
Revolt totally put down in 73
Arch of Titus: commemorates the destruction of Judea
Lots of coins made: Judea Capta (Judea has become captive)
132 CE: 2nd Revolt; Bar Kohkba
  he also makes coins
  name from Numbers 24

Rabbinic Period
