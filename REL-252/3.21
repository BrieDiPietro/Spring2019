The Law of God

All Jews were held together by beliefs and practices

***Beliefs (of 95-99% Jews)***
*Monotheism*
Deut 6:4-9 plus "And you shall love your neighbor as yourself", said everyday
Very literal interpretation: Tallit (prayer shall) with Tzitzit (touch during prayer), Tefillin (small box with Commandments on their foreheads)
Almost always a male thing, very small movement of women doing this modern day
  - monotheism: one God exists
  - polytheism:
  - monaltry/henotheism: acknowledge and worship one God, but other gods may exist

*Election and Covenant*
*Law/Torah*
"God chose us"
God of Israel (election)
Some say God gave the Law to all nations and they were the only ones that accepted
God chose and made a Covenant with the Israelites
- The Sinai/Moses Covenant: THE Covenant today
   -613 commandments total, boil down to 10 Commandments
   -First 5 are human-God, Last 5 human-human: boil down to 2, Love God Love Neighbor
   -The Law is a gift
   -Covenantal Nomism (Sanders): 8 steps
- Abraham Covenant
- Noah Covenant
- David Covenant
*Jerusalem and the Jewish Temple*
*Synagogue Life *

***More on the Law***
Different language about the Law (caught/sin, God cares about every aspect of life)
God gave it that's why you follow it. It's not just paying a fine, it's sinning against God
