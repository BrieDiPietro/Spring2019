focus on: Noah and Abraham


Joseph and asenath

**Background**
- written in Greek, lots of Syriac evidence
- between 100BCE - 100CE
- probably by a Greco-Roman guy
- to explain why Joseph married a non Hebrew
- nobody claims to have written it
- rehabilitate asenath; only in the Bible 3 times
  - daughter of Egyptian priest
  - has 2 sons
  - kids' names are Manasseh and Ephraim (2 tribes of Israel that end up being wiped off the map 722 BCE by Assyria b/c Northern kingdom)
  - she's a wife and a mom
- weird because married the daughter of Egyptian priest
- she had to completely abandon her gods and came to venerate only the God of Israel
- very concerned to show the religious practice (written later whereas Genesis didn't care about this)
*It's a tale of transformation*
*It's also a transformative tale*
- intervene and authorize Gentile inclusion
- however lots of folks disagreed, closed group

**Close Reading**
1:1-2; stylistically very similar to the Biblical story
4:9-11; recap of the Joseph story for other folks, but assumes you know he was falsely accused
8:5; parallel construction of the good that Joseph does vs the horror that is asenath; she is essentially dead
9:5-12:2; Genesis remix, language from creation narratives, give life as though she is Eve
she gets a new name and lots of language from Eden
she is the representation of the coming in of many idols
City of Refuge: technical term used in Numbers and Deuteronomy; flee there and live (avoid killed by family members)

Her transition over time: Mother -> Model -> Myth


**Paul Stuff**
NT folks love this story
Similarities to later Christian thinking
Bread of Life (Gospel of John)
