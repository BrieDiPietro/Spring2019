*Apocalypse Day*


**Definitions as a Genre (there's not just one)**
1. some kind of revelation being transmitted by vision/journey (John J. Collins)
  - person/seer is involved in dialogue with angel/heavenly tablet or book
  - angel functions as a guide/interpreter of the vision (probably not interpreted without divine help)
  - person/seer is usually from the ancient past (or takes that name)
  - two categories: *historical* (Jubilees, Animal Apocalypse, and Apocalypse of Weeks) and *Other Worldly Apocalypse* (Similitudes, Book of the Watchers)
1. present age is controlled by evil, but the world to come is a good place
  - some sort of battle or judgement (God will win)
  - end of the world scenarios
  - usher in a period of peace/righteousness
  - some sort of Messiah figure

Revelation in the NT
Daniel in the OT
The Future will be: totally new beyond human comprehension *or* return to the glories of the past (Garden of Eden)

**What Makes our Readings Apocalypses**
- Visions
- Enoch receives
- Figurative language
- Judgement
- Lots of division between good and evil
- Enoch is painted as messianic: is the "Son of Man" a response to Jesus or do the gospel writers steal some language

**Readings**
*Testament of Moses*
- 1c AD (mentions kind Herod); probably middle of the first century
- Semitic original probably Hebrew, translated to Greek and to Latin (we now have 1 Latin manuscript)
- author: someone who *hates* Herod (6), priests (7), and Hasmoneans (5)
- Moses to Joshua
- prophecy from after the fact


*Apocalypse of Weeks and Animal Apocalypse*
- 160s
- written in the name of Enoch
- Aramaic, before that Ethiopic
- both use figurative language

*Apocalypse of Weeks*
- 7s and 10s are really important
- 10 weeks; 7th week is the present
- very formulaic with 7s
- the 7th week is important because everyone has turned their backs on God

*Animal Apocalypse*
- begin with bulls/cows
- represent Adam and Eve all the way through Abraham and Isaac
- color of the animal shows evil
- after Abraham and Isaac moves to sheep (with Jacob and 12 tribes)
- wolves, camels, dogs, etc are introduced as enemies
- 70 shepherds (non-Jewish people, Gentile nations)
- 1 horned ram (Judah Maccabee)
- white bull (some Messiah)
- it may have been dangerous to actually name people
- there is no giving of the Law
- negative view toward the second temple


*Parables of Enoch*
- later than other 1Enoch
- has to be after 40 BC, but that's it basically because we don't know where the "son of man" comes from
- Semitic then Greek then Ethiopic
- named angels, including Satan
- wisdom is personified, Proverbs 8
"Son of Man"
- Daniel 7
- Ezekiel
- a few indirect comments
- "You Enoch are the Son of Man"
- Jesus takes this title
