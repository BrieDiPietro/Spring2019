very limited info: Josephus, New Testament, Rabbinical literature, some indirect references in the DSS
all of those sources have big biases (Josephus and Rabbinical are pro, NT is con)
Rabbinical Material:
- understanding Judaism in the lens of sources
- draw indirect line from Pharisee to Rabbi to what Judaism is now
New Testament:
- depicted as bad characters
- opponent of Jesus and early Christian movement

Lending money before the Sabbath year, need loans all the time so change the way loans are done to help the poor farmers
