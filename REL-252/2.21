2.21

Exam: *based on highlights*
kind of things: timeline of events (people, periods, events), slot in literature we've read, further explain a couple things (Tobit, Jubilees, Book of the Watchers and time period but also what does literature tell us about the period), languages of the Bible stuff,


***Masada and Qumran***
Judean desert
N Side of the Dead Sea is super important; Elijah taken up, Jesus baptized, river from Jerusalem to Dead Sea at the end of the World


**Masada**
- means fortress in Hebrew
- Hasmoneans and Herod built a palace and fortified it
- top is all store rooms and farm land and wall around
- walking the "Snake Path" was the only way to get there
- 73 CE is the year we're worried about
- video


**The Story of Masada According to Josephus**
- symbol of the impressive resistance "Masada will never fall again"
- 1967 onward the initiation of army men is in Masada
- lots of question marks around Josephus' account
  - sheer numbers in one palace
  - it doesn't make sense for Romans to just stop
  - 25 bodies in cave near by
  - Josephus exaggerated, he didn't make it all up
- why?
  - against Sicarii (zealots); extremists
  - blame Sicarii for the entire Jewish Revolt issue
  - pro-Roman because he is working under the Romans
  - die nobly; still proud of his people
- 3 main groups: Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes
- Maccabees in 160s BC are from this time period; groups probably in revolt against the Maccabees

**Qumran**
- Essenes are key
- NW side of Dead Sea
- 50-100 men living there
- against what happened with Hasmoneans as High priests
- monastic group
- established between 150-50 BCE
- wrote a lot, like 900 scrolls
- 68 CE the Romans destroyed everything
- hid the scrolls in caves in jars; rediscovered in 1947
- there are a couple random findings throughout history, but nothing big
- 11 caves in total have scrolls
- Cave 1: 7 scrolls
  - the most famous scrolls
  - discovered by semi-nomadic people; young boy grazing sheep/goats
  - goat wandering off, threw a rock, missed and heard shattering, check it out, broken jar brought to Cando in Bethlehem
  - set off massive rush
  - 4 of the scrolls went on tour
  - owned at the Israel museum in Jerusalem; on display
- Cave 4: 100s of fragments
- bathing was super important; ritual cleanliness
- they don't "need" to be clean, but originally it was priests so they needed to live in pure state
- thought of themselves like a temple
- compare to Paul calling himself a community temple

**some scrolls**
- 1QS The Community Rule (cave 1)
- 4Qs in great shape
- almost all scrolls are just fragments

**Essenes**
- one of three main sectarian groups/parties
- don't know a whole lot about them
- Qumran is a splinter group of Essenes; they are more strict
- okay with the Hasmoneans as High priests
- thought God was going to intervene in the world soon
- so many kinds of scrolls (sectarian, Biblical, apocryphal)
- going to the desert: probably didn't expect to stay long, an important place in their history, look forward to what's to come especially based in prophets (Isaiah 40) prepare the world,
- same thought process as John the Baptist; some thing John the Baptist was an Essene
- disease was a problem
-
