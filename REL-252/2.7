Jubilees and the Genesis Apocryphon

Questions coming in:
- Measures of time
- Changes in Ishmael/Isaac, clarify the covenant
- Removal of sex
- Leah isn't in it at all

*Jubilees*
- Written in Hebrew, translated to Syriac, Greek, Ethiopian, Latin
- Late Hasmonean Period (75BC - 50BC), but more likely probably 150-100BCE

*Genesis Apocryphon*
- 150-50 BCE
- Aramaic
- related to Jub. but uncertain how

Genesis Apocryphon
- part of DSS, cave 1
- some of the first stuff found (one of the first 7)
- no other fragments of this thing
- no idea who came first (Jubilees)

- Explanation of Abraham giving Sarah, has a dream column 19
- Explanation of how beautiful Sarah is, column 20, even though she's about 50/60

Jubilees
- very influential
- some things the author is doing (main themes) (IEJ 97-100)
  - lots of Covenant, one Covenant that is renewed and revised rather than replaced
  - Jew/Gentile separation
  - redemption for some, not for all
  - lots of just filling in gaps
  - some practices are revealed earlier than Moses; the other fathers already did all of it
  - calendar is super important
    - Jubilee: 49 or 50 years
    - week: 7 years
    - moon is not ok; sun has 364 days whereas the moon has 354 day
- huge development of angels (how God is all over all the time) and demons (evil in the world): encounter Zoroastrianism in Babylon
