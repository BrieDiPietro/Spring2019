3.14

*Priests, Levites*
- Only Levites could be tribes
- Were not given any land
- Didn't work in the traditional sense
- Supported by other people (tithe)
- Levites did daily "grunt work" of helping priests and singing and organizational
- Priests were the "more important" and in charge



In the first century about 20,000 priests/Levites
- 24 groups
- All of the priests didn't live in Jerusalem, some lived in the rural areas and came in for their work
- Different shifts throughout the day
- Both liturgical and professional butchery
  - blood and fat belong to the Lord
  - sometimes meat was eaten, it's complicated
- Levites assist in getting worshippers and their animals, man the gates, etc

Animals
- animals could not have any defects
- many sold animals for slaughter in/near the temple (Court of the Gentiles or bottom of the stairs)
- one kind of currency only so there was a uniformity
