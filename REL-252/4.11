Resurrection and Hope for the Future

**Sanders 14**

Why hope for the future?
- constantly dealing with other authorities, not free (Babylon, Persians, Alexander the Great, Ptolemys/Seleucids, Maccabees, Romans/Herods)
- hoping for better future while also looking back at tradition (David(Golden Age), Solomon, Moses)
- health (blind see, lame walk, etc)
- peace (for some group of Jews)
- punishment for enemies, subjugation

How to make it happen?
- revolt against the Romans (Judas the Galilean, the Egyptian, etc)
- praying, spiritual posture of expectation

What were Jews expecting?
- 12 tribes reunited (Jesus thought this as well, symbolic of 12 tribes)
- happen in Jerusalem, at the Temple (Essenes expected Temple to be purified then they would return)
- God of Israel will step in and make things happen

Two ways of seeing the future:
1. Utopian: ideal, perfect world, never seen it before
1. Restorative: how things used to be, like David's time or like the Garden of Eden *more common

Messiah:
- the Messiah would bring about all of these things
- a figure working on God's behalf
- exactly who/what Jews disagreed about
- many agreed Davidic sort of Messiah (military, royal) 2Sam7
- some thought Priestly Messiah, Essenes especially thought 2 messiahs (Priestly of Aaron and Davidic); Hebrews in NT
- expectation for the Nation

National resurrection
Early parts of OT: No afterlife, if there is one then it's Sheol/Pit/Abyss/Down; it isn't hell
Later parts of OT: Afterlife, rising of the dead, dead be given life again; about the time of Babylonian exile
      Babylonian Zoroastrianism does have an afterlife
      Buried in a land away from your land, so want to return
Ezekiel sees "dry bones" and God commands him to speak so that the bodies come together and then they live (Dura Europos Synagogue)
Other especially early Christian icons
John 11, Lazarus
"He will rise again on the last day, I am the resurrection"
1Corinthians 15: Jesus was raised so how could someone say no resurrection, Jesus' resurrection is the first fruit
Scars Jesus bears are recognized rather than the look of the human; maybe all people will be recognized this way
maybe these "scars" are how we are loyal to the God of Israel
Jesus had a different body altogether
Lazarus is not resurrected because he gets the same body and will die


*This life is not all that there is*
