Exile, Return, and the Early Temple Period

**The Reading**
- Daniel and Esther isn't really very historical at all, but there were probably things that happened like that
  -  Huge debate around when Daniel is written
  - Babylonian king 4-5c BCE, but usually Daniel is dated 2c
- The exactness is a bit neat and

**The Time Period**
- 2Kings 25
- documentation of the late
- 1-2Kings is the same as 1-2Chronicles
  - 1-2Kings is "why we're here"
  - 1-2Chronicles is "some good things I did"

- It was a really really bad siege; full year, people start eating their children
      586 BCE Jerusalem becomes a shell: everything burned, about 85% people exiled to Babylon, the rest flee to Egypt
        *Babylonian Captivity* taken into exile
- End of the Period of the Monarchy
Marched about 4 months to a place with new language, customs, and family
- 539 BCE: Persians defeat Babylon
  *Persian Period*
- 538 BCE: Cyrus' Edict: you can go back to your native land and set up your worship to your God

- it's a different way of ruling, he's probably not just a nice guy
*This is the Book of Ezra

        *Daniel 1, asked to eat not-Kosher food
        "we need to stay true to our faith convictions and what we eat matters"

Only some people decided to return, most stayed
Mostly it was people connected to the Temple

- Ezra 1-2 the returnees
- Ezra 3 gives the leaders and the story of foundations of the Second Temple
- 515 BCE: Second Temple is finished; no where near as grand
*Beginning of the Second Temple Period*

- 458 BCE
Ezra is a scribe
- leads a bunch of people from Babylon
- takes 4 months to travel
- Ezra's concerns: religious reform (according to the laws), assimilation, Persian representative
Ezra 9-10: a whole bunch of folks have married foreigners
- "You need to divorce those women and send them away to retain our identity"


- 440s BCE
Nehemiah is worried about safety; rebuild the wall
- took about 100 years to rebuild
- many surrounding areas didn't want it walled
  - tired of issues
  - didn't want to lose comparative influence
  - the Jews left behind at the Babylonian Captivity are considered not Jews

- the priestly line becomes VERY important
- the spoken word of God becomes very important
  - the Priests!

*The Priestly line goes through and puts together the Torah/OT*

- only the people coming back from Babylon are part of the Kingdom of God
- Samaritans are building a temple nearby at the same time (Mt. Gerizim)
- there's a chance that the Samaritans are the ones that ask to help


**Alexander the Great**
332 BCE
*Hellenistic Period*
Middle Second Temple Period

- a whole lot of folks wanted to be Greek
- how Greek can you be and still retain your core identity

Assimilation (Social Integration)
- Greek and not Jewish
- Gymnasium education (circumcision issue)
- Attend Greek athletics/theatre
- Commercial employment of non-Jews
- Confine to only the Jewish community

Acculturation (Language, Ed)
- Scholarly expertise
- Familiar (Greek lit, rhetoric, philosophy, and theology)
- Acquaintance with common moral values
- No facility in Greek at all

*Most Jews were somewhere in the middle*
*It was really just: how Greek can you be?*


**Looking Forward**
- Ptolemy was very hands off, be peaceful and we don't care
- Seleucids were not hands off


***Overall Points***
1. terminology: Israelite - Jews
2. hearing to reading
3. political leadership has moved to the High Priest
4. very hard lines of who is inside and who is outside
