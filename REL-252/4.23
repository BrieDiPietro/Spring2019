***Christianity out of Judaism, Parting of the Ways***

*New Testament Stuff*
Begins in Jerusalem
After crucifixion there started a movement around Jesus, but it took a long time
The group was inside of Judaism
The point of time in which Christianity is really its own distinct thing is a mess, probably 70s - 135
Mount of Olives: Christian side (green, churches) and Jewish side (stone and tombs)
Jews want to be buried at the Mount of Olives because that's where the messiah is coming
Mount Zion where Christianity really started, Acts 2: Disciples at Passover receive Holy Spirit and speak in other languages (Cenacle hosuing Last Supper, Upper Room)
Below the Upper Room is the Tomb of David
Christianity spread slowly into Ethiopian eunuch, coast, Galilee
Paul travels 50s targets Gentiles
Quickly, by the end of first century mostly gentile movement

*Paul*
Col 1:15-19
Jesus = God in power/glory
John 10:30  "The father and I are one"
-boundaries of monotheism get pushed-
being Jewish doesn't make you righteous, faith in Jesus makes someone righteous
the only thing that counts is faith
-how central is the Law/Torah-
2Cor 6:16 we are a temple
-the Temple is not always in Jerusalem-
frequently redefines Jewish terms

about 60ish Romans can tell the difference between Jews and Christians (general terms in certain areas)

*Dates*
30 Jesus crucified
50s Paul's letters
70 Temple Destruction
where the separation is really happening
135 Second Jewish Revolt
315/320 Christianity is legal in Roman empire

Jewish text: Birkath ha-minim
12th benediction was added about end of 1st beginning of 2nd century
basically "let the Christian assholes be blotted from the Book of Life"

Christian texts:
Didache (100) hypocrites
Ignatius living in Judaism is saying not received Christ
Barnabus (110-130) Christians only ones to really understand Torah, Jews called former people
Justin Martyr: Dialogue with Trypho the scriptures are our scriptures, not yours
Melito of Sardis: Paschal Homily super intense sermon, Jews killed God
