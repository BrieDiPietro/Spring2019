*What are the Pseudepigrapha and Apocrypha*
really just 2nd Temple Period writing outside of "canon"
- Apocrypha: attached to "hidden things"
- Pseudepigrapha: false writing
- Apocrypha is work that is in some Bibles, but not all of them
  - 13ish of them total
  - 250BCE - 1BCE
- Pseudepigrapha is rarely considered Biblical
  - 40-50 of them total
  - 250BCE - 150CE
  - most of our readings throughout the semester

**Apocrypha**
- extra books in the Septuagint
  - now called Apocrypha; in the LXX but not in the Hebrew Bible
  - written by Jews for Jews
  - became the Christian Texts
- The Christians recognized the difference between the LXX and HB
- "Profitable to read, but not at the same level" -Jerome

**Jerome**
- translated Septuagint into Latin; Vulgate
- this is the basis for Catholics today
- recognized the difference in Apocrypha, but translated anyway
- they were a part of the Bible

**Reformation**
- Martin Luther said "profitable to read"
- Some said "don't read them at all"
- Reformers wanted to be able to read the Hebrew, then realized that the Hebrew is super different
- Reformers then said that these books shouldn't be Biblical
  - Catholics: Include Apocrypha; Council of Trent 1545
  - Protestants: No Apocrypha

"Jesus probably didn't know Greek"


----
***Tobit***

- mid 3rd - early 2nd BCE, Persian Period (ends 332 BCE); 300 - 100
- written under pseudonym about the Persian period in the diaspora, but definitely written afterward
- Important cities: Nineveh
- Hebrew/Aramaic translated into Greek; a few tiny chunks in Hebrew/Aramaic survive
- storyline
  - living the way he should
  - blinded by sparrows
  - prays for death, but remembers money in Persia
  - travels with Raphael (God heals)
  - meet a fish and used his parts
  - meet Sarah; 7 husbands all dead because demon
  - prays for death as well
  - get married, celebrate 14 days
- the important stuff
  - Tobit is law observant; knows and follows the Commandments
    - 1.16 bury the dead, give money/food poor (almsgiving)
    - burying the dead is great because they physically can't repay you; it's impossible to be seaking a reward
    - really important and pious
    - treasury of merit
    - צדקה or "almsgiving" eventually literally translates to "righteousness"
  - presence of angels and demons
    - actually named
    - huge interest in angels, demons, afterlife (CCOT of Judaism)
    - we have no idea why


***Judith***
- probably about Hasmonean Period (160BCE - 63BCE) about 140s, but references all of the different periods
- specifically set prior to the Hasmonean
- no clue who wrote it
- written in Greek
- storyline
  - Judea is threatened by Assyria
  - puts herself in the line of danger to save her people
  - seduces the Assyrian general, beheads him
- it's a popular story
  - underdog story: 2 people take down 120,000 ish people
  - defeated by a woman
  - following God's law; won't eat the food
  - rely on God the entire time, she was never on her own
  - rise in the importance to prayer (maybe related to rise of angels and demons)
- really interesting parallels with Judas Maccabean
  - it's definitely fiction and everyone (even in the ancient world) know that
- Nebuchadnezzar similar to Antiochus I
- General Nicanor in the Syrians is beheaded and put on display

***Additions to Daniel***
Susanna
- later centuries, 200, in the Septuagint
- followed the law strictly
- story of God coming through in the weakest time
- intro to Daniel
- name puns are neat
- more of an intro to Daniel than a story about Susanna

Bel and the Dragon
- king enlists Daniel to get rid of the idol
- Daniel always follows his own God
- priests are eating all of the food, Bel can't eat
- Daniel stays true to the God of Israel and God rescued him
- stay true to God of Israel because God will defend you

Prayer of Azariah
- Jews thrown in the fire
- They end up being definitely
- long prayer in the middle while they were in the fire
- given their Hebrew names
