2.12

*1Enoch*

- 300BCE - 100AD (it's a big book across a whole lot)
- Aramaic
- Collection of many authors
- Clarify intertestamental theology (a lot of early Christian and Jewish)
- before DSS book was known (Greek, Latin, Ethiopic)
- post DSS confirm Aramaic


- 1-36 (Book of the Watchers); 300-200BC
- 37-71 Parables/Similitudes; 100BC-100CE we don't really know
- 72-82 Astronomical Book; 300-200BC
- 83-90 Dream Visions (animal apocolypse); 160s BC
- 91-107 Epistle of Enoch; 160s BC


*Super Influential at Qumran*
- all except Parables found at Qumran
- Book of the Giants (found at Qumran, but not part of modern Enoch)
**Tertullian**
- argues in Rome that this is Biblical, scriptural
- it was very influential and important to early Christians

- seems like a conspiracy in Jewish rabbinical work because they don't include it and if they do it's not kind

*Who is Enoch*
- "walked with God" "God took him" Genesis 5:21-24
- speculation that Enoch never died
- "scribe of righteousness" he's an educated guy
- watchers ask Enoch to intercede for them
- Enoch is elevated and the watchers are brought down
- because Enoch is heaven, he can write stuff down; he gives the book to Methusalah (his son)

*Who are the fallen angels*
- Took wives of the people
- Heroes of the old (Gen. 6:1-4)
- Isaiah 14:12-14 "daystar sun of the dawn"
- Ezekiel 28
- very little actual info
- all of the speculation

*Looking at the Book*
- the sin: have children with mortals, taught the secrets of heaven (medicine, incantations, plants), taught about weapons, drink blood, cosmetics, precious stones
- revealed light/lightning/shooting stars
- Enoch learns these things when he goes to heaven, so knowledge isn't inherently bad
- forced to stay on earth
- demons come from the dead souls
- God destroys 9/10 of these demons
    - God is more powerful than the demons
    - there is still evil in the world
    - the demon has to ask permission
- the angels are cast into a not heaven and not hell (1Enoch 21)

*Existence of Evil*
- watchers: Enochic Judaism
- Adam and Eve
- Lilith

Jews say that Adam and Eve sinning is something they do, it is not passed down
