*Aristocrats and Sadducees*
wealthy, power, influence, family line
The Food Chain: High priests, chief priests, overseer of the temple/treasurer/, priests, Levites
Probably Sadducees: high priests, chief priests
Probably not: Levitical priests/sons of Aaron/Zadok/Hasmoneans/Herod chooses
Tiny group because you have to have influence in the temple
Chief priests are probably old high priests that were disposed of, kind of like former presidents
High priest "first among equals"
Duties of High/Chief Priests
- mediate between people/secular leaders
- political and economic office
- enforce law
Sanhedrin/Gerousia (appointed): not sure what they did, advisory board, sort of Jewish supreme court, a lot of them were Sadducees
4 Aristocratic Families: Annas (Caiphas most famous of them), always in charge when a Christian is put to death
Respect the office even if the current priest sucks

Sadduceen beliefs (we don't really know a whole lot): literalist/fundamentalist, live by the Bible not by interpretation (but you have to interpret), deny resurrection, no afterlife, believe in free will
