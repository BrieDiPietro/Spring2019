Notes from Emily Sink

Magness, Stone and Dung

Chapter 1: Footprints in Archeology and Text
Characteristics that distinguished the Jews
Classes
Priest, elite, Pharisees, commoners
This influences how to interpret archeological findings, different daily lives among Jews
Sectarianism
Essennes, Pharisees, Sadducees (Jerusalem elite)
Differ on purity laws and interpretation of laws -- what does it mean to be Jewish?
These do not coincide with the economic classes
Orthopraxy - correct practice or behaviors (what you do matters)
Judaism - differentiated in the sectarian groups
Orthodoxy - faith/belief matters most (what you think matters)
Christianity
Purity and Holiness

Chapter 2: Purifying the Body and Hands
Ritual baths (miqveh)
Hand washing before meals
Priests only one required to eat their food in a ritually pure state
Many Jews decided to do this too
Concern for purity >>>> in this time period
Significance rises and falls over time
Hands defiled when touching a holy Torah scroll (a similar theme seen throughout history)
Jesus changes the significance of these laws - scriptural implications

Materials
Glass -  can convey impurity
Stone - cannot convey impurity

Dining
Sitting or reclining on something - does it matter?
Reclining a more Gentile custom (triclinium table - last supper)
Communal meals significant
Slow, community forming, relationships significant

Sabbath and Fasting
Makes a specific time sacred, sanctification of time
God rested too - He made resting holy
You enter into the Sabbath
How do you rest?
You canâ€™t work or make something else work
Eruvin - house (combination of neighborhoods) - connected by string
Can carry anything in this area
Pharisees started this
