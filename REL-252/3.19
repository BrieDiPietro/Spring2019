3.19


Looking at the map

Tiberias and Sepphoris bigger cities with 15 to 20 thousand
Outside of Tiberias/Sepheras very rural villages; 200 to a couple thousand people
Villages more Jewish; cities have Greek sort of temptation

*Sea of Galilee*
largest fresh water lake in 100 miles or so
600 feet below sea level
storms very sudden
surrounded by hills

*Nazareth*
Largest city in N Israel
Used to be very very small; about the size of modern church
Largely Israeli Arab
about 50/50 Muslim/Christian
Small Village Life
- several extended families living in the same area
- about 200 at most
- grow wheat or barley
- shepherd sheep or goats
- lots of olives
- no mason/wood jobs, Jesus probably went to Sepphoris for work
- very poor tiny life
- you leave if you can

*Capernaum*
on the Sea of Galilee
known for fishing
- 7 hot springs bubbling
- Jordan river connects
Ancient Synagogue (4th century) built on the foundation of 1st century Synagogue
1000/1500 people ish
more opportunity for growth
  - fishing
  - fishing industry
  - farming
  - shepherd
  - olives
  - tax collector
  - major trade route
just more happening
Jesus grew up in Nazareth, but moved to Capernaum where he may have had a house
Living in Galilee
- Galilee was home
- Jerusalem was still the center for religious life
- town of 1000ish Jews making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with 100,000 peole with all Jews


*Bigger Cities Tiberias and Sepphoris*
Gentiles are around a lot more
more influence

*Synagogues*
one in many towns
getting to the Temple can sometimes just be plain unrealistic
not many 1st century synagogues left (ex. Magdala, Masada, Herodium)
also exist in diaspora (ex. Delos (could be Samaritan or Jewish), Theodotus Inscription)
built to worship God
*Torah* is the key
stored in Torah Ark
Origins are disputed
- 586 BCE Jews wanted to study together in diaspora
- city gates where important people were; Synagogue didn't begin as a religious institution
- began across the diaspora; Egyptian proseuche (prayer house)
3rd century BCE earliest hard evidence of communal Jewish life


*Chap 1 and 2 Readings*
Synagogue and Temple have a complicated relation ship
Some Jews consider the words interchangeable, but everyone knew they weren't *the* temple
Once the Temple is gone the synagogues begin to "templize"
Formalize worship/liturgy
