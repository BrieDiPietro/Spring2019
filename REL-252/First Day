the exile

we will be around 200 BCE to 100 CE; Late Second Temple Period


***Naming***
****The Period****
 - Late Judaism: problem because says Judaism isn't almost over
 - Early Judaism: Israelites until this time, then called Jews
 - Second Temple Period/Judaism: historical name identifying the Temple
 - Intertestamental Period: time between OT and NT; very Christian way of thinking

****The Thought****
- Normative Judaism
- Common Judaism
- Judaism is really really huge and complicated so it's hard to give one
- Two main streams: "Legal Judaism" and "Apocalyptic Judaism"
  Not opposite, but usually not the same
      Legal: what you should be doing, this world
      Apocalyptic: what's happening in heaven to effect what's happening in life; angels and demons, messiah
- Judaism"s" : Second Temple Judaisms : Makes sense but that's weird

***Literature***
- there's so much
- we know very little about 530 BCE to 200 because writing just didn't stick
- 1870s - 1980s ish folks start putting stuff together
- Dead Sea Scrolls
- My main man Josephus, tons of details that we've used a lot
- Philo, the Egyptian Jew, wanted to make Judaism make sense to Greeks
- Jewish Rabbis, Mishnah, legal stuff mostly
- there's really so so much

***Terms***
- Israelites: ancient person
- Jews: ongoing term beginning around 500 BCE
- Israelis: Jews living in Israel

- Judaism/Jew isn't really that, it's Judean
      Judea: A geographical place; not a religious term, but legal or political. about 200 BCE there's a switch to "Jew"
- Issue of debate around what we should call these people
