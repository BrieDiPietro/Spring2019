Textual Development

Hebrew Bible: Counts 24
Christian OT: 39
*It's the entirely same content, there isn't any differnce at all*

**Jewish/Hebrew Bible**
  - Torah
  - Prophets
  - Writings
- Sort of arranged in order: Torah is the heart and oldest, prophets and history are intertwined
- Ending in a hope saying that we will be returned to the *land*
- Earliest reference to the 3 chunks, Luke 24:44 especially "Law, Prophet, Writing"

**Christian OT**
- Law
- Histories
- Wisdom Literature/Poetry
- Prophets
  - Ending in the statement of a new *figure* (Elijah) which points to Jesus in the NT


**Deciding the Books of the Hebrew Bible**
- Priests were part of the process
- We really have no idea though
- Later rabbis after temple destruction have some say
- The Torah especially: the weight of history


**Talking about the Reading**
    ***Abbreviations***
    - MT: Masoretic Text; Hebrew with some Aramaic
    - LXX: Septuagint; Greek
    - OG: Old Greek, very close to LXX but includes more; Greek
    - SP: Samaritan Pentateuch; Proto Hebrew
    - DSS: Dead Sea Scrolls

- Oldest Hebrew Bible Text 8th or 9th century
- LXX in Greek and Aramaic
*Divinely Ordained*

***Samaritan Pentateuch***
- relatives of the Jews
-  6000 variants between MT and SP
- "Sectarian Text" a specific agenda is being pushed
  - 10 Commandments changed a whole bunch: Build an altar on Mt Gerazim
  - Exodus 27:10 pushes the "will choose in Israel" to a past tense
  - Deut 27:4 place of standing stone laws
