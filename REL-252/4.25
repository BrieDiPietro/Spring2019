***Early Judaism and Rabbinic Judaism***

*Overview*
Rabbis were different in time and perception of the world
70: Temple Destruction
200: Mishnah put together
Early rabbis more well known (Hillel and Shamai)
Live just before Jesus, but we have none of their actual write
Some are in Acts: Gamaliel the elder, Gamaliel; Some super famous ones
Prefer oral tradition, 200/220 Mishnah put together
Babylonian Talmud, Shabbat 31a: famous story about teaching the Torah
Pretty much never an actual decision
Yavneh/Jamnia becomes the first center of rabbinic study
Eventually, the Galilee is more important: Tiberius and Sephoras
Center of Jewish learning moves north

Tannaiti Period: 70-220, early Rabbis (Tannaim Rabbis); teaching, reciting
Tosefta also written a bit after Mishnah
Amoraic Period: 220-500, late rabbis (Amoraim Rabbis);
Ends with Jerusalem Talmud (400) and Babylonian Talmud (500)
Babylonian is more important, aka Bably
2 main centers of Jewish learning

- Sometimes no messiah, sometimes 1 messiah (common), sometimes 2 messiahs
- Rabbis didn't care about 2nd Temple Writing (only really use Ben Sira)
