**Looking at the homework for next class**
- how do ancients think


**Talking about the article: Early Jewish Biblical Interpretation**
James Kugel
- a modern Orthodox Jew
- everyone just agreed that these were important and authoritative, read it as sacred
- same of the prophetic (Joshua, Judges, 1-2 Samuel, 1-2 Kings, Isaiah)
- lots of people were focusing on and reading these texts
- texts became important, it's very different from other cultures
- there's a prescriptive quality: they know something about that past that tell you about the future
- breaking a law is different because it is committing a sin; there's a huge difference
- becomes a moral issue than a law issue
- people needed to understand the Bible/Biblical interpreters
    - language/word change
    - places change names
    - make things relevant to present
    - to make it comprehensive
    - really big and consequential questions
    - figure out what things were meant to teach
- people didn't put their name on stuff because they didn't think it was their property
    - it didn't matter as much
    - message was way more important than authorship
*in the Bible*
- first born of the favorite wife/ of the not favored wife
- roast/boil the Passover Lamb

*outside of the Bible*
- 3rd BC to 2nd CE
- rewritten Bible
- commentary isn't a thing

*the 4 assumptions*
1. the texts are cryptic
  - scriptural texts says A, but means B
2. they are relevant and import for the present/future
  - the New Testament uses a bunch of them
  - 1Cor 10:11 "written down to instruct us"
3. unity of the message over time, harmonious: not self evident
  - everything lines up somehow
  - omnisignificance: every detail matters
4. some of the texts have a divine origin

it's all Midrash
"making an interpretation of the text"
"saying something important about the text"
