Amos 1-5

mid 8th century BC (750)
westward movement of Tiglath-Pilesar III (745) puts him in this time

no name for agent of destruction: no name for Assyria yet, but it will be soon

**Cultural Context**
- Israel (N Kingdom), King Jeroboam II
- Samaria is capital, super prosperous
  - enemy is Aram/Damascus
  - Israel had beaten out local enemies
- Amos travels to Bethel (house of God) in Israel
- Bethel is an ancient holy site
- Jerusalem is great and David got it and what not, the Davidic kingdom loves it
  - before that, there were a bunch of smaller sanctuary cities
  - Samuel (ex) would travel to all of the littler sanctuary cities
  - Jeroboam (1st king of just Israel) reemphasizes Bethel and Dan specifically as bigger sanctuary cities
- Israel encountered God in both N and S throughout history in the form of covenant

**Covenants**
- Prophet Nathan says to David (covenant, unbroken and royal line of rulers in Jerusalem)
- Davidic Covenant
- Mosaic Covenant: Moses is key, in the wilderness (Sinai)
  - conditional covenant: there are laws/requirements/stipulations
  - the covenant can be broken
  - there are several kinds of laws
    - apodictic: set in stone laws, unchanging, 10 Commandments
    - casuastic: specific situations, based on cases
    - ceremonial laws: sacrifices, purity, etc
  - you can reject the covenant whenever
  - lots of law regarding widows, orphans, immigrants (and others but these are the big ones)

- Purpose of the law
  - keep God happy
  - keep order
  - caring for others
  - Deut 6: God gave this stuff "for our lasting good... we will be in the right"
  - basically, God set us free
  - vision of human community

- *Boils down to Justice and Righteousness*
  - do these things to be in the right
  - it is for our lasting good

**Amos brings the law (as a prophet does)**
Jeroboam: rules 41 years, gets 1 paragraph in 2Kings
  - very powerful and great
  - Amos comes in and says "you're in super deep shit"
  - deep shit because: taking advantage of the vulnerable, based on their own desires, the wealthy are too wealthy (High Priest, business owners, etc)
  - think they're blessed because rich, but Amos says that it's just that they take from the weak
  - you're in danger and you don't even know it
  - foreigner comes in and tells them "God hates you"
  - Amos comes in hot anyway: uses imagery, rhetorical strategies, very extreme language

Look out for: socio-economic context, rhetorical strategies, and historical context
