Talking through Amos

**Socio-Economics**
- Amos 6:4-6
- 7:15 took from being a shepherd
  - is he a poor shepherd or a dresser of sycamores (land owner)
- Showing off Bethel as a Royal Sanctuary City; dynamics of religious leadership
- 6:14 raising up a nation against you; is this Assyria?

**Handful of Passages**
- Early on (chapter 2) go across the map/compass declaring punishment
- Judah: Keeping the Torah is central, as it is the connection to the Covenant
- 2:6 talking about the sale of people into debt slavery
  - this is a violation of the Covenant
- sacred prostitution; prostitutes working out of temples to practice ritual stuff
- Israel has the Covenant and they therefore know exactly what's expected and still ignore it
- How complete will the destruction be: Amos 3:12
- Israel has broken the Covenant. The Covenant is over. There is now no hope or future. No remnant.
- "houses of ivory" have been found
- 4:1 cows are equal to Cadillac, symbol of wealth and ease
- Day of the Lord: God will come as king, warrior, judge to deliver the righteous and crush the rich

Amos is not saying that sacrifice is bad, he's saying that *your* sacrifice is bad
Worship must be accompanied by righteous lives

**Visions**
- There's a series of visions
- basket of fruit = the end of time; same Hebrew word
